# Missionaries-Cannibals_problem

Three missionaries meet three hungry cannibals at the edge of a river. Next 
to them is a boat that can take a maximum of two people. They must find 
a sequence of crossings that allow both them and the cannibals to cross 
the river safely.
● The boat can not cross the river empty.
● At no time should more cannibals than missionaries be left on one of 
the  banks  of  the  river,  for  if  that  happened,  the  missionaries  would 
perish in the jaws of the hungry cannibals.
